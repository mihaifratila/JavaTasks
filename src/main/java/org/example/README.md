5. Throw BeatlesException defined above if a given random string is not found in your song text."
### Part 5: Fix this Set. It should contain 3 Objects
~~~ java
   import java.util.HashSet;
   import java.util.Set;
   public class SetProblem {
   static class User {
   private String name;
   private int age;
   public User(String name, int age) {
   this.name = name;
   this.age = age;
   }
   public String getName() {
   return name;
   }
   public void setName(String name) {
   this.name = name;
   }
   public int getAge() {
   return age;
   }
   public void setAge(int age) {
   this.age = age;
   }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   Set<User> users = new HashSet<>();
   users.add(new User("Max", 27));
   users.add(new User("Veronika", 20));
   users.add(new User("Denis", 30));
   users.add(new User("Max", 27));

           if (users.size() == 3) {
           System.out.println("System works well!");
           } else {
           throw new RuntimeException("Users set size should be 3!");
           }
   }
   }

String testFoeSearch = "When you first start to evaluate a cloud migration, the decisions to be made, stakeholders who need to be involved, it can sometimes feel overwhelming – and with good reason. A move to the cloud can take time, resources, and manpower, and while companies are nearly universally glad they made those investments, that doesn't cancel out the fact that they take strategic planning and up-front work."
+ "What do you need to plan for? Who needs to be involved (and when)? What roles and responsibilities need to be divided up? The answers vary a bit depending on your company size, the scope of your migration, and whether you have the budget (or need) for a migration partner."
+ "Below are the typical roles and responsibilities we see from successful migrations – and some tips to prepare your team for success. Because without the right team in place, missed deadlines, duplicative work, and post-migration workflow issues become much greater risks.";
